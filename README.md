## For manuscript/project: ``Investigating Resiliency of Transportation Network Under Targeted and Potential Climate Change Disruptions''
Network Data
- `railonly.csv': Rail Freight
- `wateronly.csv': Water Freight
  
Latest's Files for analysis and plots:
- `LOCA2`: Summary of climate analysis from 8 downscalled CMIP6 ESMs.
- `plots`: Plots of robustness and spatial change in hot days
- `CleanPlots.ipynb`: Latest robustness plot (in revised manuscript)
- `HeatWave_NERSC-Clean.ipynb`: Since the downscaled models are huge, the analysis was done on a super computer ( I should have added that in acknowledgement)
- `HeatWaveModelAverage.ipynb`: Spatial map of change in hot days (Figure 2)
