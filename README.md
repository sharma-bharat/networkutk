New changes:
- LOCA2: Summary of climate analysis from 8 downscalled CMIP6 ESMs.
- plots: Plots of robustness and spatial change in hot days
- CleanPlots.ipynb: Latest robustness plot (in revised manuscript)
- HeatWave_NERSC-Clean.ipynb: Since the downscaled models are huge, the analysis was done on a super computer ( I should have added that in acknowledgement)
- HeatWaveModelAverage.ipynb: Spatial map of change in hot days (Figure 2)
